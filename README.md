Abstract:
  With the spread of misinformation across the internet, many social media platforms are turningto  artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  to  detect  and  remove  fraudulent  information.   Oneprevalent example is the rise in machine learning techniques that utilize Natural Language Process-ing (NLP) alongside classification models to categorize social media posts.  In this study, multipleclassification models were built alongside NLP techniques to classify whether or not a Tweet referredto a real natural disaster.  Predictive models such as Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Multi-nomial Na ̈ıve Bayes Classification were implemented with a goal of determining the model best suitedto classify both the uncleaned and cleaned dataset of 10,000 Tweets.  Overall, the best-performingmodel, for both the uncleaned and cleaned data, was found to be a Multinomial Na ̈ıve Bayes Classi-fier that learned class prior probabilities, with the most accurate of the two yielding cross-validationscores of 0.680976, 0.659710, and 0.731981 across 3 folds.
